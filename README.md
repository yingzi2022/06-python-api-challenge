Python API homework for Northwestern Data Scientist Boot Camp

# Executive Summary
This week homework requirement is to answer a fundamental question: 
    - What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

Analysis were generated to answer the question from the following persepctives: 
    1. Geographic locations (patterns): What is weather pattern (or temperature changes) within a year across cities where are far from the equator to the closer ones?
    2. Time of year (patterns): What is weather like across the seasons (like summer, winter) for cities?
    3. Temperature preference (patterns): For each cities, When is the desirable and ideal season for visit based on temperature? (cities good for visit for ski, swimming, attractions)

From the analysis, we observed the following:
   
    <to-do items: two to three observable trends>

As a result, the following two deliverables were generated to visulaize the results:  
    - A heat map of the weather of 500+ cities of varying distance from the equator (WeatherPy)
    - A list of places/cities with desireable temperature recommended for future vacation (VacationPy)
